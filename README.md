# Chet-Parke-Portfolio

Hello! And welcome to my portfolio. My name is Chet Parke and this repository is my cybersecurity portfolio, showcasing hands-on labs, vulnerability write-ups, small automation tools, and security projects I’ve completed while building my skills. It includes practical work in web security, cloud basics, and defensive analysis.
